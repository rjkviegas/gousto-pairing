# Gousto Pairing Session

## Specification

Initial Specification:
```
You'll be asked to do some pair programming on a small project, inspired by something we shipped at Gousto. Expect to read some simple json data, do some transformation on it and output some sort of result based on this data. The final result doesn't matter as much, but we expect some flavour of tests. We're more interested in seeing your thought process and how you approach a coding problem than the final output. You can chose the language of your choice for this exercise, and may want to prepare some basic skeleton to save time on the boilerplate
```

Domain: JSON data
Range: ???
